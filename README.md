# BF2SinopiaExperiments
Here in, I add a few Resource Templates I am working on to study Sinopia bibframe editor, json, and the various aspects.

_Includes a current draft of the Work, Instance, Item, Dissertation, and RareStuff RTs_

Hoping to update these as they are updated for: https://stage.sinopia.io/ and for https://.sinopia.io/
1. This process also involves tweaking the json with a text editor (in this context, it's easiest to use ATOM) and the GITHUB windows client
2. Some of the changes are done through the GUI: https://profile-editor.sinopia.io/#/profile/sinopia
